Preface:
This is the requirements document made for a database of a Data-Mining-Startup. The program will be coded based on the requirements written here.
Introduction:
The system shall be used as a database for a Data-Mining-Startup. The database is written in Java and uses a TOMCAT-Server and the SERVLET-interface and follows the rules of a REST-Framework. The data are collected in a RDF-format (in Triples of subject, predicate and object) and can be analyzed by the measures of Data Mining and Machine Learning algorithms. Those algorithms, which are executed on a central server, are taken from the WEKA project of the University of Waikato with focus on classification of the data. Other functions and algorithms will be added to the database later. The program will be used in a web environment on common web browsers and can be accessed by authorized users, whose date will be saved on the server and also anonymous users, who have limited rights. The system is a stand-alone database that uses data sets of .arff or .csv type. As the main database of an enterprise this program is crucial for the company’s success and therefore should be reliably working.
